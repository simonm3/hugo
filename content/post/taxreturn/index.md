This spreadsheet mirrors the HMRC "view my calculation" screen at the end of your tax return. Have not found any similar spreadsheet available to do this. It can be downloaded using the button here...  {{<download taxreturn.xlsx>}}
 
## Purpose

1. Better understand the HMRC calculation especially the interaction of income, capital gains and dividends.
2. Forecast how much income is in the high and low rate bands so that you can optimise tax
    * Reduce the amount of income in the high rate band e.g using pension contributions or shifting income into another tax year
    * Generate gains to utilise unused basic rate allowance. This will taxed at the 10% tax rate now in anticipation that rates will increase in the future.
    * Estimate how much tax will be due to enable cash flow planning
3. Check the tax return has been fully completed and is correct
